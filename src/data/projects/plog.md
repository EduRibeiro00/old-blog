* CLI application for a "distribution company" that calculates the best routes for delivery trucks that need to go to certain pharmacies to deliver goods.
* The problem is an instance of the **Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRP-TW)**; the goal is to generate the schedule of the distribution company, while minimizing both the number of trucks used and the overall distance traveled by the trucks.
* Done using Prolog and its **clpfd restrictions library**.
