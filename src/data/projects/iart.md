* Extracted Covid-19 data from a Kaggle dataset that contained the confirmed, death, and recovered cases for each day and for each country/region; developed and trained several regression models with the goal of successfully predicting Covid-19 cases and deaths.
* Used data visualization Python libraries to create graphs in order to better understand data patterns.
* Utilized the following models and methods: Neural Networks, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbours and Random Forest.
* The Kaggle dataset used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report?select=covid_19_clean_complete.csv).
