* Developed a tool that serves as a compiler of .jmm files, written in the Java-- language, a subset of the Java language.
* Implemented various compilation stages, like the lexical and syntactic analysis, the semantic analysis, and the code generation phase.
* Worked on several compiler optimizations: liveness analysis, register allocation, constant propagation and folding, and dead code removal.
