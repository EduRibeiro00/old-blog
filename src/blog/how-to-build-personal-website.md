> As a software developer, one of the best mediums you can use to market yourself is a blog. It‚Äôs my firm belief that every software developer who cares about their career should invest in creating a blog.

This quote is from [John Sonmez](https://twitter.com/simpleprogrammr), a software developer and the author of two best selling books on tech and career development.

In this article I will talk about why you may want to build your own personal website or blog, and how you can do it easily using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

# Why would you build a personal website?

John Sonmez, alongside with a lot of other people, talks a lot about blogging and how it is important. 
Writing articles on various tech topics can help you become a better developer and communicator, as there is a lot of researching, coding and learning behind a blog post. 

It can be helpful if you are a freelancer or an independent consultant, as it can bring a lot of clients and customers your way instead of letting them simply find you by themselves. It also helps you expose yourself to others, increasing your networking skills and making you meet new people sometimes. Finally, it also serves as a way to pass the knowledge that you have to others and give back to the community.

But, you may ask yourself, *"Why should I waste time on having my own blog when I can simply post on already established platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/) or [DEV](https://dev.to/)?"*

There are several reasons for having your own platform:

* You will not be dependent on any other platform. You own it and you have the freedom to do what you want
* The website is *yours*: you can customize it and make it look and function according to your needs and likes
* You can monetize your blog in the future, if you want, with ads for example
* You can still publish on Medium or Dev, and redirect readers to your personal blog!

For me, besides all the reasons stated above, I took this as an **opportunity to start a new Web project**, so for those of you who are interested in having a small side project in Web Development, this can help you with that üòÅ

If that convinced you into maybe trying to build your own personal site or blog, I will explain how I did it in the next sections, and how you can too.

- muitas pessoas s√£o talentosas / com muito potencial mas n√£o se exp√µem o suficiente
- projeto perfeito para fazer isso e ao mesmo tempo ter qualquer coisa personalizada / √† tua maneira
- √© mais um side project q pode ser interessante para quem est√° na √°rea, especialmente para quem est√° interessado em Web

# The technologies I used

## Gatsby

![Gatsby image](./images/gatsby.jpeg)

To put it concisely, [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is a [React](https://reactjs.org/)-based, [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) powered, static site generator. It uses powerful pre-configuration to build a website that uses only static files (meaning it delivers the same files for all users/visitors) for incredibly fast page loads.

It uses GraphQL to collect from wherever it may be: Markdown, JSON, third party APIs, anywhere! At build time, it creates an internal GraphQL server of all of this data. So, in your React components, all of your data is queried at build time from there.

Gatsby, despite not being around for too long (release it 2017), has great documentation to help you get acquainted quickly. It also has a lot of different [plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins) that add functionality and help you customize your site.

# Some things I had in mind

There were some things I had in mind and some decisions I made before and while building this project.

## Developing from Scratch

- queria ter a experi√™ncia total de web dev (embora use uma css framework), mas queria comecar do zero, e n√£o usar nenhum template
- no entanto, para quem quiser perder menos tempo com o c√≥digo e ser mais r√°pido a ter algo funcional para se concentrar na escrita, pode utilizar templates do gatsby (mostrar templates que podem ser utilizados)

## Optimize SEO

- explicar o que √© e porque √© importante para ter visibilidade
- explicar o que pode ser feito para melhorar SEO
- falar de react-helmet e do meu SEO component
